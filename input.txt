Maybe in another life
I could find you there
Pulled away before your time
I can't deal, it's so unfair
And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it feels, yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold now that you've gone away
Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
Black roses and "Hail Mary's"
Can't bring back what's taken from me
I reach to the sky and call out your name
And if I could trade, I would
And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it stings, yeah, it stings now
The world is so cold now that you've gone away
Now that you've gone away
I reach to the sky and call out your name
And if I could trade, I would
And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it feels, yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold now that you've gone away
